# Contributing to the Terraform Provider for OpenNebula

Thanks for getting involved in the Terraform Provider for OpenNebula. Here are a few step to read before contributing to this project.

## Set up you development environment

### Tools

* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install)

### Building from sources

```shell
export tf_arch=linux_amd64
export tf_one_version=0.0.1
export branch=master
¬†
# Clone terraform-provider-opennebula
git clone git@github.com:OpenNebula/terraform-provider-opennebula.git
¬†
# Switch to the devired dev branch
cd terraform-provider-opennebula
git switch $branch
¬†
# Build the Provider
go clean
go build

# Create directory under Terraform plugins directory
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.terraform.d/plugins/one.test/one/opennebula/${tf_one_version}/${tf_arch}
¬†
# Create a link to the Provider binary
ln -s $(pwd)/terraform-provider-opennebula ${HOME}/.terraform.d/plugins/one.test/one/opennebula/${tf_one_version}/${tf_arch}
```

Now you can create a new `main.tf` file:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    opennebula = {
      source  = "one.test/one/opennebula"
    }
  }
}

provider "opennebula" {
  # ...
}

resource "opennebula_image" "image" {
  # ...
}
```

During the `terraform init`, the provider should be initialized as `unauthenticated`:

```text
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of one.test/one/opennebula...
- Installing one.test/one/opennebula v0.0.1...
- Installed one.test/one/opennebula v0.0.1 (unauthenticated)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```
