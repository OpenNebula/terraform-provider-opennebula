# Contributing to the Terraform Provider for OpenNebula

Thanks for getting involved in the Terraform Provider for OpenNebula. Here are a few step to read before contributing to this project.

## Set up you development environment

### Tools

* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install)

### Local development of the provider

To develop and use this provider locally, you can leverage the [`dev_override`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers) feature of the terraform CLI.
To do so, create a `$HOME/.terraformrc` file if it doesn't exist yet (see the [`terraform` CLI documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#locations) for different consideration for Windows systems) with the following content:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "OpenNebula/opennebula" = "[LOCAL_PATH_TO_THIS_REPO]"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

This configuration will not apply any change for `terraform init` or your `.terraform.lock.hcl`. From the Terraform documentation:
```text
With development overrides in effect, the terraform init command will still attempt to select a suitable published
version of your provider to install and record in the dependency lock file for future use, but other commands like
terraform apply will disregard the lock file's entry and will use the given directory instead.
```

This configuration will check for the `terraform-provider-opennebula` binary at the given directory. You can generate it using `make build`

Example:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    opennebula = {
      source = "OpenNebula/opennebula" # use the real provider as source
      version = "1.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "opennebula" {
  # ...
}

data opennebula_datastore "my_datastore" {
  # ...
}
```

Applying changes for the above simple terraform module shows the override in action:
```txt
$> terraform apply
‚ï∑
‚îÇ Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
‚îÇ 
‚îÇ The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
‚îÇ  - opennebula/opennebula in [LOCAL_PATH_TO_THIS_REPO]
‚îÇ 
‚îÇ The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published releases.
‚ïµ
data.opennebula_datastore.my_datastore: Reading...
data.opennebula_datastore.my_datastore: Read complete after 0s

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

### Debugging

You can locally debug the provider and the provider tests using [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) or an IDE like VisualStudio Code.

You can find more information about the provider debugging process in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/debugging).

#### Prerequisites

Install delve:
```
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

In case you are using VisualStudio Code, ensure that you have the [go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) installed.

#### Debugging the provider in VisualStudio Code

For debugging the provider in vscode, you should create a new `launch.json` configuration file (if not exists) in your repository `.vscode` folder, containing, at least, the following configuration:
```
//.vscode/launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug Terraform Provider",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "env": {},
            "args": [
                "-debug"
            ],
            "output": "${workspaceFolder}/terraform-provider-opennebula"
        },
        [...]
    ]
}
```

Then, you can go to the `Run and Debug` section and execute the `Debug Terraform Provider` configuration. The debug console should open and show a message like the following one:
```
Provider started. To attach Terraform CLI, set the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS environment variable with the following:

	TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"OpenNebula/opennebula":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":619134,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/tmp/plugin4171993516"}}}'
```

Copy the `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` environment variable and its content and now you can set some breakpoints in your code. Finally, call the terraform CLI prepending the `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` in order to let the terraform CLI attach to the debugged terraform provider process, e.g.

```
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"OpenNebula/opennebula":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":619134,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/tmp/plugin4171993516"}}}' terraform plan
```

The process execution should stop on the breakpoint you set in vscode, allowing you to debug the opennebula provider.

>NOTE: for ensuring that you are referencing the local opennebula terraform provider when debugging you should have configured the `dev_override` in your `$HOME/.terraformrc` file. Follow the steps described in the [Local development of the provider](#local-development-of-the-provider) section.

#### Debugging the provider tests in VisualStudio Code

The process for debugging the provider tests in vscode is similar to the previous one, but in the case of the tests, the provider testing framework will compile and load in memory the local provider code, so in this case we won't need to override the terraform provider reference through the `dev_override` feature.

In the case of debugging the tests, we can add a configuration in the `.vscode/launch.json` file specifying the tests to run (with the `-test.run` arg) and setting the necessary environment variables for executing the acceptance tests and attacking our local Opennebula instance), e.g:
```
//.vscode/launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Debug Terraform Provider Tests",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "mode": "test",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/opennebula",
        "args": ["-test.run", "^TestAccDataSourceOpennebulaVirtualNetworkAddressRange$"],
        "env": {
          "TF_LOG": "DEBUG",
          "TF_ACC": "1",
          "OPENNEBULA_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:2633/RPC2",
          "OPENNEBULA_USERNAME": "oneadmin",
          "OPENNEBULA_PASSWORD": "opennebula",
          "OPENNEBULA_FLOW_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:2474"
        },
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
      },
      [...]
    ]
}
```

>Remember to replace the `-test.run` arg with the desired acceptance test to execute and debug!

Now, you can set a breakpoint in any test case and debug it executing the `Debug Terraform Provider Tests` launch configuration.
