# opennebula_virtual_network

Provides an OpenNebula virtual network resource.

This resource allows you to manage virtual networks on your OpenNebula clusters. When applied,
a new virtual network is created. When destroyed, that virtual network is removed.

## Example Usage

### Reservation of a virtual network

Allocate a new virtual network from the parent virtual network "394":

```hcl
resource "opennebula_virtual_network" "reservation" {
    name             = "terravnetres"
    description      = "my terraform vnet"
    reservation_vnet = 394
    reservation_size = 5
    security_groups  = [ 0 ]
}
```

### Virtual network creation

```hcl
resource "opennebula_virtual_network" "vnet" {
    name            = "tarravnet"
    permissions     = "660"
    group           = opennebula_group.group.name
    bridge          = "br0"
    physical_device = "eth0"
    type            = "fw"
    mtu             = 1500
    dns             = "172.16.100.1"
    gateway         = "172.16.100.1"
    security_groups = [ 0 ]
    clusters        = [ 0 ]
    ar {
         ar_type = "IP4"
         size    = 16
         ip4     = "172.16.100.101"
    }
    tags = {
      environment = "dev"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `security_groups` - (Optional) List of security group IDs to apply on the virtual network.
* `bridge` - (Optional) Name of the bridge interface to which the virtual network should be associated. Conflicts with `reservation_vnet` and `reservation_size`.
* `physical_device` - (Optional) Name of the physical device interface to which the virtual network should be associated. Conflicts with `reservation_vnet` and `reservation_size`.
* `type` - (Optional) Virtual network type. One of these: `dummy`, `bridge`'`fw`, `ebtables`, `802.1Q`, `vxlan` or `ovswitch`. Defaults to `bridge`. Conflicts with `reservation_vnet` and `reservation_size`.
* `clusters` - (Optional) List of cluster IDs where the virtual network can be use. Conflicts with `reservation_vnet` and `reservation_size`.

## Import

To import an existing virtual network #1234 into Terraform, add this declaration to your .tf file (don't specify the reservation_size):

```hcl
resource "opennebula_virtual_network" "importtest" {
    name             = "importedvnet"
    reservation_vnet = 394
    security_groups  = ["0"]
}
```

And then run:

```
terraform import opennebula_virtual_network.importtest 1234
```

Verify that Terraform does not perform any change:

```
terraform plan
```
