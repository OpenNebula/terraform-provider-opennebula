# opennebula_acl

Provides an OpenNebula ACL resource.

This resource allows you to manage ACLs on your OpenNebula clusters. When applied,
a new ACL is created. When destroyed, this ACL is removed. Note that ACLs currently cannot be changed, hence they are deleted and re-created upon change.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opennebula_acl" "acl" {
    user     = "@1"
    resource = "HOST+CLUSTER+DATASTORE/*"
    rights   = "USE+MANAGE+ADMIN"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `user` - (Required) User component of the new rule.
    - `#<id>` matches a single user id
    - `@<id>` matches a group id
    - `*` matches everything.
* `resource` - (Required) Resource component of the new rule. Any combination of valid resources, separated by a `+`.

  **Must contain a slash for resource subset.**
  Resource subset string uses the same syntax as the User-string, and additionally supports `%<id>` to limit by Cluster ID.

  The following objects are valid:
    - VM
    - HOST
    - NET
    - IMAGE
    - USER
    - TEMPLATE
    - GROUP
    - DATASTORE

    - SECGROUP
    - VDC
    - VROUTER
    - MARKETPLACE
    - MARKETPLACEAPP
    - VMGROUP
    - VNTEMPLATE
* `rights` - (Optional) Rights component of the new rule. Any combination of valid Rights, separated by a `+`.

  The following rights are valid:
    - USE
    - MANAGE
    - ADMIN
    - CREATE
* `zone` - (Optional) Zone component of the new rule.
    - `#<id>` matches a single zone id
    - `*` matches everything.


## Import

To import an existing ACL #134 into Terraform, add this declaration to your .tf file:

```hcl
resource "opennebula_acl" "importacl" {
    user     = "@1"
    resource = "HOST+CLUSTER+DATASTORE/*"
    rights   = "USE+MANAGE+ADMIN"
}
```

And then run:

```
terraform import opennebula_acl.importacl 134
```

Verify that Terraform does not perform any change:
